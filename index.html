            <blockquote>
              <p>The Associated Students of Harvey Mudd College(ASHMC) refers broadly to the Harvey Mudd Student community as a whole. All registered students at Harvey Mudd College are members of ASHMC and therefore maintain the ability to influence the culture and community at Harvey Mudd. Colloquially, ASHMC refers to our student government, which engages with student interests on campus; aiming to make Harvey Mudd a place where all students are supported by the community in the pursuit of their goals and their livelihoods. </p>
